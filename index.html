     I  Abosolutely, love the hole Series it is very, awesome, and i have watched it a lot of times. Stephinie Meyer did a great job writting the books. 17 The First Twilight Movie Made More Money During Its Opening Than Any Other Film Directed By A Woman. Dakota Faninning is one of the Characters, Patrick Stewart too, and Kristen Stewart. And do not forget Taylor Launter!!
